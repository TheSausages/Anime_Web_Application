## Introduction

This a rewrite of my bachelor's thesis application. The main goal of this project is to experiment with technologies, including but not limited to:
- Cloud technologies
- Front- and Backend frameworks/libraries/etc.
- Documentation and management tools (ex. API, tasks)
- Metric and data collection
- Github (wiki, actions, etc.)
- Encryption tools (sops)

Many aspects of the project may not be optimal/correct (ex. using an APi gateway for such a simple app), but the goal is to check out as many different ideas as possible, even if they are not needed. Additionally the documentation may not be ideal, as the project is concentrated more with the code side.

## Wiki

Most information and documentation on the project can be found in github wiki [found here](https://github.com/TheSausages/Anime_Web_Application/wiki)

## Technologies Used

List of main technologies used. Complete list can be found in the respective [wiki page](https://github.com/TheSausages/Anime_Web_Application/wiki/Technologies-used).
