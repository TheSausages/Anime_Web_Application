## Introduction

This a rewrite of my bachelor's thesis application. The main goal of this project is to experiment with technologies, including but not limited to:
- Cloud technologies
- Front- and Backend frameworks/libraries/etc.
- Documentation and management tools (ex. API, tasks)
- Metric and data collection
- Github (wiki, actions, etc.)

Many aspects of the project may not be optimal/correct (ex. using an APi gateway for such a simple app), but the goal is to chekc out as many different ideals as possible, even if they are not needed here.

## Wiki
